          Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and
          for server-side scripting. The ability to run JavaScript code on the
          server is often used to generate dynamic web page content before the
          page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js
          represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm,[6] unifying
          web-application development around a single programming language, as
          opposed to using different languages for the server- versus
          client-side programming. The HTMLelement will fire an event when the
          user clicks the button. So it defines an addEventListener() function,
          which we are calling here. We're passing in two parameters: the string
          "click", to indicate that we want to listen to the click event.
          Buttons can fire lots of other events, such as "mouseover" when the
          user moves their mouse over the button, or "keydown" when the user
          presses a key and the button is focused. a function to call when the
          event happens. In our case, the function generates a random RGB color
